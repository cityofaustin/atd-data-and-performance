## Authority

In December 2011, Austin's City Council voted to officially support the adoption of an open government framework. In 2013, the City Manager delivered a four-point plan for making City operations more open. This plan, known as the [Open Government Directive]({{site.baseurl}}/directive), identifies multiple performance expectations related to open data.
