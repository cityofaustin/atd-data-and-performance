            This dashboard reports the progress of the Austin Transportation Department's Annual Signal Timing Program. Beginning in 2017, traffic signal engineers will re-time approximately 1/3 of the cityâ€™s 1,000+ signals each year, with the goal of ensuring signals are timed for optimum safety and performance.
