          <p>This webpage reports the status of traffic and pedestrian signal requests. Every year we typically receive more than one hundred requests for traffic and pedestrian signals, each of which is evaluated and ranked for possible installation.</p>

          <p>This page shows the status of new and existing signal requests, as well as those locations that are currently being studied or have been studied but not yet constructed.</p>

          <p> <a href='http://www.austintexas.gov/department/arterial-management' target="_blank" > Click here </a> for more details about the signal request process. </p>

          <h3>Evaluation and Study</h3>

          <p> Eligible request are assigned preliminary scores based on crash history, travel demand, and community context. The highest scoring requests are selected for study by a professional engineer, who makes a formal recommendation for signalization.</p>
