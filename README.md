# Austin Transportation Data and Performance Hub

This repository houses the City of Austin Transportation Department's Data and Performance Hub, a public website which tracks the department's operational performance and curates access to key datasets.

This site is hosted at [transportation.austintexas.io](http://transportation.austintexas.io) and uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to create static pages.

Much of the content on the site is generated in-browser using [D3js](http://d3js.org) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) to visualize data from the [City of Austin Open Data Portal](http://data.austintexas.gov).

## Quick Start

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

2. `cd` to the directory where you want to check-out the site, and clone it (`git clone https://github.com/cityofaustin/transportation`)

3. `cd` to the directory that contains the cloned repository, and run `jekyll serve` to start the webserver

4. Navigate to http://localhost:4000 in your browser to view the site hosted-locally
