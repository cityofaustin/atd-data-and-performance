## Open transportation data at City of Austin

**This repo is primarily a collaboration space. Not much coding here!**

### Background

Austin Transportation wants to increase the amount of open data it publishes to data.austintexas.gov and is collaborating with partners across the City to make this happen. Austin Transportation is also working to develop standards for cataloguing key structural assets such as locations of school zones, traffic signs, and beacons.
