      Our Mission
    </h2>
    <p>
      We leverage high quality data and modern technologies to empower Austin Transportation staff to improve operations, make data-informed decisions, and deliver excellent mobility services to the Austin community. We solve real problems for real people.

    <h2>
      How We Work
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Embrace Change
    </h3>
    <p>
      Business needs change; technologies evolve. We welcome new challenges, and improve by adapting to and embracing change. We are stubborn about our goals, but flexible in our methods.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Users First and Always
    </h3>
    <p>
      We build only what people really need, nothing more. User needs are the driver for all decisions. We build with our users, keeping them involved in our process through ideation, sprint reviews, demos, and usability testing.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Empower Great People
    </h3>
    <p>
      Our work empowers civil servants to discover and cultivate new skills. We aim to provide opportunities for personal and professional growth, and to empower the public to engage with their government through open information and collaboration.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Default to Open
    </h3>
    <p>
      The residents of Austin are at the top of our org chart. We share everything we do so that we can collaborate with the public and receive critical feedback. Before we restrict access to a line of code, a dataset, a design brief, or an app, we ask, “Why?”
    </p>
    <h3>
      Nurture, Include, and Grow Together
    </h3>
    <p>
      Delivering great tech cannot not come at the cost of our personal wellbeing. We commit to building a safe and inclusive workplace by looking out for each other, listening to each other, and advocating for each other.
